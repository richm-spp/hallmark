# Step 1 — Design-context gate (full protocol)

Loaded on route from SKILL.md § 1. This file carries the prompt format, the
genre-detection signals, the custom-theme signals, and the opt-out protocol;
SKILL.md keeps the three questions and the always-ask rule.

## The prompt format

> *Before I build, I need three things:*
>
> *1. **Audience** — Who will use this? What do they care about?*
> *2. **Use case** — What's the one action the page should drive? (Sign up? Subscribe? Read? Buy?)*
> *3. **Tone** — Pick an extreme: editorial · brutalist · soft · utilitarian · luxury · playful · technical · austere. "Clean and modern" isn't a tone.*
>
> *Or say **"go ahead"** and I'll infer from the brief — I'll tell you what I picked.*

Send the prompt **once**, in one message. Bold the three labels (Audience / Use case / Tone) so the user can scan them. Do not ladder follow-ups; if the user answers some fields and skips others, treat the skipped fields as opt-out and infer them. If the user says "go ahead", "you pick", "just build it", "don't ask", or doesn't engage after one prompt, the inference protocol below kicks in.

**One exception** where the gate is silent:
- The skill is invoked with `audit`, `study`, or `redesign --mood` — those verbs read context from the target, not the user.

There is no "the brief looks complete" exception. There is no "the user already named all three" exception. There is no length threshold below which asking is skipped. A long, detailed brief gets the same three-question prompt as a five-word one — the user can wave you through with *"go ahead"* in two seconds. **Default is to ask. The cost of asking is one extra message; the cost of guessing wrong is a whole rebuild.**

## Genre — pick before themes

Before the theme route, settle on a genre. Hallmark ships four: **editorial** (default · the canonical anti-slop voice), **modern-minimal** (Stripe / Linear / ElevenLabs school), **atmospheric** (Suno / Runway / dark-AI-tool school), **playful** (post-Linear soft school). The genre scopes which themes can rotate, which slop-test gates apply, and which voice fixtures the LLM picks from. Detection is signal-based — silent default to editorial unless the brief fires one of these:

- *AI tool, generative, music, video, voice, late-night, dark mode, atmospheric* → **atmospheric** → load [`genres/atmospheric.md`](genres/atmospheric.md)
- *SaaS, enterprise, API, platform, developer tool, infra, B2B, dev experience* → **modern-minimal** → load [`genres/modern-minimal.md`](genres/modern-minimal.md)
- *fun, consumer, casual, friendly, onboarding, family, community* → **playful** → load [`genres/playful.md`](genres/playful.md)

If two non-default signals fire (rare), ask one short follow-up: *"This brief fits both modern-minimal and atmospheric — which feels closer? \[modern-minimal · atmospheric]"*. Default with no signal: silent **editorial** → load [`genres/editorial.md`](genres/editorial.md). The chosen genre file is loaded eagerly (it scopes everything downstream); other genre files stay on disk.

State the genre out loud at Step 2.5 alongside the macrostructure and theme picks: *"Genre: atmospheric. Macrostructure: Marquee Hero. Theme: Bloom (atmospheric cluster)."*

## Theme route — only surface when the brief signals it

Hallmark has two theme routes: **catalog** (the 21 named themes — Specimen, Atelier, Brutal, Newsprint, Studio, Manifesto, Terminal, Midnight, Almanac, Garden, Riso, Sport, Bloom, Coral, Cobalt, Aurora, Editorial, Carnival, Lumen, Hum, Grid) and **custom** (made-to-measure for one brief — a *tuned* OKLCH palette + free-font pairing on Hallmark's structures, or, when the brief's structure itself is the ask, a fully *bespoke* page designed from first principles; bound by every slop-test gate either way; see [`custom-theme.md`](custom-theme.md)). **Catalog is the default.** The catalog rotation is *scoped to the genre's theme cluster* — atmospheric rotates Bloom/Midnight/Terminal/Aurora/Lumen, modern-minimal rotates Coral/Cobalt, playful stays on Hum, editorial walks the remaining thirteen (Specimen, Atelier, Brutal, Newsprint, Studio, Manifesto, Almanac, Garden, Riso, Sport, Editorial, Carnival, Grid). Do **not** offer the user a choice on every prompt — that's friction, not discipline. Surface the catalog/custom fork only when the brief carries one of these signals:

- The user explicitly says **custom theme** / **tailored to our brand** / **make it ours** / **something unique** / **play with the colors and fonts**.
- The user names a **specific brand colour** as the anchor (e.g., "use our terracotta", "the brand red is hex #c0392b", "anchor on sea-blue").
- The user describes a **multi-attribute aesthetic that doesn't map to a single catalog theme** — three or more vibe words pointing at a specific feel (e.g., "moss, lichen, soft pink, herbal" / "sun-drenched, market-day, carbon-black" / "late-night, neon, brutalist deli"). One adjective ("warm", "technical", "playful") is *not* a custom signal — that's a tone, and the catalog already carries it.
- The user attaches a **brand-mood reference** (a colour swatch, a moodboard, a Pantone chip) without asking to study a screenshot.

If any of those fires, ask one short follow-up before picking: *"This brief reads like a custom palette would fit better than the catalog. Want me to construct a custom OKLCH palette + free-font pairing tuned to <one-line summary of the vibe>, or stay on the catalog for variety + speed?"* Wait for the user to say custom (or catalog). Default is still catalog — silence routes to catalog, not custom.

**Custom has two depths** — *tuned* (a palette + fonts on Hallmark's structures) and *bespoke* (a page designed from first principles, own structure too) for when the brief's **structure itself** is the ask: "no theme / from scratch / fully bespoke", or a page-shape no catalog macrostructure fits. Both fire the one fork above, default to catalog on silence, and **pass every slop-test gate** — the depth simply follows the brief. See [`custom-theme.md`](custom-theme.md) § Bespoke depth.

If none of the signals fires, **proceed with catalog silently. Do not mention the fork.** Most briefs don't need a custom theme — the catalog's 21 themes plus the rotation rule already deliver structural variety. See SKILL.md Step 2.6 for the dispatch.

## Opt-out / inference protocol

**If the user opts out or skips fields** (says "go ahead", "you pick", "skip", "just build it", "don't ask", answers some fields and leaves others blank, or simply doesn't engage with the question after one prompt):

- Infer audience, use case, and tone from the brief, the domain, and any visible context (filename, framework, surrounding code is fair game *now* — only because the user delegated).
- **State the inferences in one sentence at the top of your reply** — *"Going with: audience = X · use = Y · tone = Z. If any of those is wrong, tell me and I'll redirect."*
- Stamp them in the CSS comment alongside the macrostructure (Step 6). The stamp is now the durable record.
- Pick a **non-default** macrostructure — Specimen-fall-through is still banned, even on inferred briefs.

**Do not skip the inference disclosure.** The opt-out is a courtesy to lazy users, not an excuse for the skill to be opaque. If the user can't see what was inferred, they can't redirect when it's wrong.

Once the three are settled (asked or inferred), restate them in one sentence and proceed.
